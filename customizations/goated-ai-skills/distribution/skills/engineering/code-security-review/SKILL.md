# Code Security Review

## Purpose

Perform a focused static security review of a change or source area before closeout. The goal is to catch high-evidence exploitable risks: broken access control, unsafe trust-boundary crossings, data leaks, auth mistakes, injection paths, unsafe execution, unsafe configuration, secret exposure, and security-relevant reliability bugs.

This is a review gate, not a full security audit, penetration test, dependency audit, compliance review, standards review, or spec review. Absence of findings means no high-evidence issue was found in the reviewed scope; it does not prove the system is secure.

## Activation

Load this skill when a reachable trust boundary changes or the reviewed work
touches a security-sensitive surface: authentication, authorization,
permissions, tenant/user isolation, secrets, private or restricted data,
database/storage policy, untrusted parsing, shell or code execution, network
egress, dependency/install behavior, deployment security, or privileged
configuration.

Do not load it for presentation-only, wording-only, or local logic changes with
no credible trust path or sensitive surface. Record a skip only when its reason
is material to the route; do not add ceremonial security reports.

## Inputs

- User request and target-project root path.
- Fixed point for the review, such as a base commit, branch, tag, PR base, issue-start commit, or supplied patch.
- Changed files, diffs, commits, staged changes, unstaged changes, generated files, migrations, config changes, or source area under review.
- Originating issue, PRD, ticket, accepted plan, standards/spec review, TDD evidence, or user-stated intent when available.
- Relevant source files, tests, schemas, permissions, policies, routes, controllers, services, repositories, UI surfaces, CLI commands, jobs, deployment config, dependency manifests, lockfiles, and security docs.
- Project security model when present: roles, tenants, auth providers, data classification, secrets policy, sandbox policy, threat model, privacy constraints, compliance notes, or documented trusted boundaries.

## Dependencies

Hard: None.

Soft:
- session-start-progressive-disclosure for unfamiliar target projects
- standards-and-spec-review when issue, changed files, or intended behavior are unclear
- tdd when security-relevant behavior changed and needs regression proof
- project-standards-calibration when security, dependency, logging, privacy, or config standards affect review
- doc-sync when security assumptions, public behavior, config, or threat-model docs may drift
- verification-before-completion for complex, high-risk, delegated,
  multi-surface, or explicitly audited security closeout

Fallback: If companion skills, git history, security docs, dependency metadata, or checks are unavailable, inspect minimal local evidence, state lower confidence, and report residual risk instead of speculative findings.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the review scope:
   - Reuse fresh envelope evidence for the diff, fixed point, intended behavior,
     guards, and relevant tests. Refresh evidence changed by implementation or
     too shallow for the security claim.
   - Identify the target-project root and whether the review covers committed changes, staged changes, unstaged changes, a supplied patch, or a named source area.
   - Identify the fixed point. Prefer an explicit user-provided base, PR metadata, branch upstream, merge-base with the likely trunk branch, or the issue-start commit.
   - List changed files before reviewing. In git projects, use an equivalent of `git status --short`, `git diff --name-status <fixed-point>...HEAD`, and working-tree diff commands as appropriate for the requested scope.
   - Identify the originating issue, standards/spec review, PRD, ticket, or explicit request when it helps determine intended behavior.
   - Use non-mutating commands by default. Do not format, generate, migrate, rewrite, auto-fix, or upgrade dependencies during the review unless the user separately asks for implementation.

2. Build an evidence path before judging:
   - For each security-relevant change, TRACE a concrete path from reachable trigger or entry point to trust boundary to sensitive asset or dangerous sink.
   - A finding needs a reachable trigger, crossed trust boundary, missing or broken guard, affected asset or sink, and impact.
   - Read [Security Review Checklist](references/security-review-checklist.md) when the scope spans multiple surfaces or you need entry point, trust-boundary, asset, sink, risk-class, or severity examples.
   - Use the checklist as coverage guidance, not as proof.
   - Do not proceed from a vague concern to a finding. If no path can be traced, keep it as residual risk or a validation note.

3. Review high-risk classes:
   - ANALYZE access control, injection and parser paths, web or client exposure, data handling, persistence and policy, execution and platform behavior, dependency or supply-chain changes, and security-relevant reliability.
   - Use the local checklist to avoid missed classes in non-trivial reviews.
   - Report only when changed evidence proves a concrete exploitability path, concrete exposure, or vulnerable version path.

4. Validate context and false positives:
   - Report only findings with strong static evidence, roughly 80% confidence or higher.
   - Strong evidence means the review can name the reachable trigger, affected path, missing or broken guard, impacted asset, and why existing framework or project behavior does not neutralize the issue.
   - Cross-check framework defaults, type safety, existing middleware, validation, ownership checks, policies, transaction behavior, test fixtures, and deployment config before reporting.
   - If a pattern is suspicious but exploitability depends on missing facts, do not promote it to a finding. Record the missing validation under residual risk.
   - If validation needs runtime access, production-like config, captured logs, request traces, or human interaction, ask for that artifact or permission for a safe validation environment instead of guessing.
   - If static evidence proves a dangerous flaw but one external fact could change severity, report it at the lower defensible severity and include `[CONTEXT NEEDED]` with the exact validation needed.
   - Remove duplicate findings. When multiple paths share one root cause, report one finding with representative evidence and affected paths.

5. Classify severity:
   - Classify conservatively: `CRITICAL` for proven systemic, cross-user, cross-tenant, destructive, or code-execution compromise; `HIGH` for exploitable leak, escalation, policy bypass, sensitive token exposure, or repeatable integrity abuse; `MEDIUM` for bounded exploitability, dangerous patterns missing one external fact, or triggerable integrity or availability harm; `LOW` for limited posture, defense-in-depth, or future-risk issues tied to the reviewed path.
   - Use the local checklist for severity examples when classification is uncertain.
   - Omit `LOW` findings unless the user asked for broad scanning or the issue is directly tied to a significant reviewed path.

6. Report and route next work:
   - Keep this review separate from standards/spec review. Do not report style, naming, test coverage, architecture, or unrequested-scope concerns unless they directly create exploitable risk.
   - Include precise affected paths and line references when possible.
   - Include CWE or OWASP labels only when they fit confidently.
   - If web access is available and the label matters for reviewer clarity, verify the label against the optional references below.
   - If no exact label is known, use a plain vulnerability category instead of inventing an ID.
   - Recommend concrete remediation that matches the project architecture and framework defaults.
   - State assumptions, skipped checks, unavailable evidence, and residual risk.
   - Recommend implementation fixes for findings, `doc-sync` for changed security assumptions or public docs, and a fuller audit only when the reviewed scope leaves material unexamined risk.
   - Verify findings and no-findings wording against fresh scoped evidence.
     Load `verification-before-completion` only when complexity, risk,
     delegation, multiple surfaces, or an explicit audit warrants it.
   - Emit findings, residual-risk changes, and route deltas into the envelope;
     do not duplicate the controller's closeout.

## Output Contract

Return one compact security delta:

```markdown
- Scope and coverage: fixed point, changed paths, activated sensitive surface,
  evidence inspected, and “static review gate; not a full audit.”
- Trust path: entry point, boundary, asset or sink, and existing guard.
- Finding: severity, affected path, category, evidence, impact, fix,
  confidence, and false-positive control; or a scoped no-high-evidence-finding
  statement.
- Residual risk and route delta: only changed assumptions, skipped validation,
  required fixes, documentation impact, fuller-audit need, or other next gate.
```

Do not repeat the full work envelope, standards/spec findings, or a separate
completion summary.

## Delegation

Main owns scope, trust-boundary judgment, classification, false-positive
control, and communication. Delegate only bounded surface mapping, one concrete
trust path, candidate validation, or policy/default research.

Return paths and commands, line-level evidence where possible, assumptions,
confidence, residual risk, status, and candidate severity, impact, fix, and
false-positive notes. Resolve concerns or missing context before reporting;
narrow or stop on `BLOCKED`. Without delegation, review sequentially.

## Guardrails

- Do not claim full security audit coverage, penetration-test coverage, compliance signoff, or absence of vulnerabilities.
- Do not report speculative vulnerabilities. Without a concrete trigger, boundary, missing guard, affected asset, and impact, record residual risk instead.
- Do not mix standards/spec findings into this review. Route missed requirements, unrequested scope, style, naming, and local convention issues to `standards-and-spec-review`.
- Do not rely solely on automated scanners, grep hits, dependency warnings, or pattern matching. Treat tools as triage; verify the execution path before reporting.
- Do not run mutating commands such as formatters, generators, migrations, dependency upgrades, auto-fixers, exploit scripts against live systems, or destructive proof-of-concept actions unless the user explicitly asks for implementation and approves the risk.
- Do not copy secrets, tokens, private user data, customer data, or sensitive logs into the report. Identify the path and exposure class without repeating the secret.
- Do not invent CWE, OWASP, or CVE labels. Use `Category` when an exact identifier is not necessary or not known.
- Do not treat missing project security docs, absent tests, or no dependency audit tooling as findings by themselves. Report them as residual risk unless they create a proven exploitable path.
- Do not broaden into architecture redesign, dependency modernization, doc-sync, commit writing, or handoff unless the user separately requests that work.
- Do not include private notes, ignored local scratch files, credentials, client data, sensitive personal context, or real user data in review output.
- Do not require this source repo's root docs after installation. The skill may rely only on its own folder files and target-project evidence.
