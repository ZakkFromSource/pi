# Documentation Writer

## Purpose

Create or substantially revise durable documentation that helps humans understand and use a project, product, workflow, or operational process.

Use this skill for planned documentation authoring: manuals, operator guides, runbooks, troubleshooting guides, onboarding guides, durable product docs, and optional AI-facing guide docs. Keep it separate from `doc-sync`: this skill writes planned docs from source evidence and audience needs; `doc-sync` checks whether changed behavior or docs made other durable docs stale.

Human-facing docs come first. AI-facing guides are separate artifacts used only when requested or useful for repeated agent or model work.

## Inputs

- User request, documentation goal, target audience, desired doc type, scope, and freshness expectations.
- Target-project root path and applicable project or agent instructions.
- Existing documentation conventions, docs indexes, README files, manuals, guides, runbooks, product docs, and agent docs.
- Source evidence such as code, tests, commands, product notes, PRDs, issues, ADRs, schemas, config, logs, support notes, screenshots, or user-provided context.
- Known private or sensitive material that must not be copied into durable docs.
- Verification tools or manual checks available for Markdown, links, generated docs, screenshots, commands, or product behavior.

## Dependencies

Hard: None.

Soft:
- session-start-progressive-disclosure for unfamiliar target projects
- grill-with-docs when audience, purpose, scope, terminology, product behavior, or documentation ownership is unclear
- write-a-spec when requirements, acceptance criteria, or feature intent are not settled
- doc-sync when documentation changes may leave catalogs, standards, guidance, or other docs stale
- verification-before-completion before ready/source-grounded/checked/synced/complete docs claims
- handoff when remaining gaps, skipped evidence, or documentation ownership need continuity

Fallback: If companion skills, docs, source access, or review tools are unavailable, inspect minimal evidence, write narrower docs, label assumptions/gaps, and avoid unverifiable readiness claims.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the documentation contract:
   - Identify whether the task is a new doc, substantial revision, AI-facing guide, or drift-only check.
   - Route drift-only work to `doc-sync`; route unsettled product intent to `write-a-spec`; route unclear audience or scope to `grill-with-docs`.
   - Do not load `documentation-cleanup` unless the task also has an evidenced
     structural hygiene need.
   - State the intended doc type, audience, scope, owner if known, and readiness claim being pursued.
   - Ask only for product intent or preference that cannot be discovered from local evidence.

2. Gather source evidence before writing:
   - Find the target-project documentation conventions before choosing a path.
   - Inspect relevant existing docs, context artifacts, source files, tests, commands, PRDs, issues, ADRs, schemas, config, or user-provided materials.
   - Separate verified facts, stale or conflicting sources, assumptions, skipped evidence, and unresolved product questions.
   - Stop and ask which source wins when source behavior, product intent, and existing docs conflict in a way that changes the documentation claim.

3. Choose the documentation location:
   - Prefer the target project's existing docs convention, naming style, and index structure.
   - If no convention exists, default human-facing durable Markdown to `docs/<topic>-guide.md`.
   - If a separate AI-facing guide is requested or useful and no convention exists, default to `docs/agents/<topic>-ai-guide.md`.
   - Record location assumptions instead of presenting defaults as universal rules.

4. Shape the doc for the audience:
   - Read [Manual Patterns And QA](references/manual-patterns-and-qa.md) when choosing a doc type, shaping an AI-facing guide, or running doc QA before closeout.
   - Keep human docs task-oriented, readable, and audience-specific.
   - Keep AI-facing guides separate from human manuals by default. They should help agents load the right facts quickly, not replace human docs or become the only source of product behavior.
   - Prefer concise sections, examples, commands, warnings, and next reads that match the audience's real task.

5. Draft from evidence:
   - Write durable Markdown in the project's style unless another existing convention clearly applies.
   - Link or name source evidence enough for a future maintainer to verify major claims.
   - Mark assumptions, gaps, outdated areas, missing screenshots, unverified commands, or product questions explicitly.
   - Do not paste raw transcripts, private notes, credentials, real user data, or sensitive context into tracked docs.

6. Verify the documentation:
   - Re-read edited docs and nearby headings for flow, accuracy, audience fit, stale wording, broken local links, and unsupported claims.
   - Run doc lint, link check, render, command, or product verification only when the project defines a safe check or the user asks for it.
   - For AI-facing guides, verify that the file is separate, concise, source-linked, and named as a guide rather than a context source of truth.
   - Record skipped checks and residual risk rather than claiming readiness from uninspected evidence.

7. Route follow-up:
   - Use `doc-sync` after documentation changes when catalogs, README summaries, standards, operator docs, public workflow descriptions, or other durable docs may now be stale.
   - Use `verification-before-completion` before claiming the documentation is ready, complete, source-grounded, or synced.
   - Use `handoff` when gaps, owner questions, or deferred verification need continuity.

## Output Contract

The requested document is the primary output. In integrated use, return only
the artifact delta needed by the main agent: created or updated paths, source
evidence, verification, material gaps, and a `documentation-impact` route
signal when sync may be needed. Omit empty fields and do not repeat the task
closeout.

Standalone use adds a compact local closeout after the document. When no doc
should be written, state the reason and owning route, such as `doc-sync`,
`write-a-spec`, `grill-with-docs`, or a user decision.

## Delegation

Main owns audience judgment, source-of-truth decisions, final wording, target location, verification claims, and user communication.

Delegate only bounded independent passes: summarize one source/doc/PRD/issue/command family, discover docs conventions, review outline and audience fit, evaluate AI-facing guide usefulness, or QA unsupported claims, private-data risk, broken links, stale wording, and static-site scope creep.

If subagents are unavailable, run the same checks sequentially with a narrower context budget.

## Guardrails

- Do not write planned documentation before gathering source evidence.
- Do not use `documentation-writer` for drift-only checks; route those to `doc-sync`.
- Do not turn human manuals into agent scratchpads. Keep AI-facing guidance separate by default.
- Do not name AI-facing guides as context sources when the project already uses context docs for durable language, source maps, or routing.
- Do not create documentation webpages, static sites, publishing workflows, hosting guidance, generated navigation, or deployment steps unless a separate approved scope explicitly asks for them.
- Do not invent product behavior, support promises, commands, SLAs, architecture, permissions, or troubleshooting steps.
- Do not hide mismatches between source behavior and intended behavior by documenting the mismatch away; surface the conflict and route to the right planning or implementation workflow.
- Do not paste credentials, secrets, private notes, raw transcripts, client data, sensitive personal context, real user data, or ignored scratch content into durable docs.
- Do not claim docs are complete, current, source-grounded, synced, or ready when relevant sources or checks were skipped.
- Do not require this source repo's root files, issue files, `.local/` notes, or chat history after installation. The skill may rely only on its own files and target-project evidence.
