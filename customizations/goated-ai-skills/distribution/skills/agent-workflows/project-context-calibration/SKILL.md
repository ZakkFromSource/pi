# Project Context Calibration

## Purpose

Create or incrementally refresh a durable target-project `CONTEXT.md` that
gives future agents one shared vocabulary.

Activate it only when the onboarding artifact budget includes project context
because boundaries, terms, artifact meanings, or reusable architecture language
are missing, stale, or repeatedly confused. Do not create `CONTEXT.md` as a
universal onboarding requirement.

## Inputs

- User request or onboarding goal.
- Target-project root path.
- Existing `docs/agents/context-matrix.md`, if present.
- Existing root `CONTEXT.md`, if refreshing.
- Existing `docs/agents/project-standards.md`, if present.
- Project README files, docs indexes, glossary or domain docs, ADRs, PRDs, issue templates, architecture notes, agent instructions, and public docs.
- Representative source or tests only when docs are missing, stale, or insufficient to ground important project language.
- User decisions about project terms, scope boundaries, and artifact meanings when local evidence cannot settle them.
- Selected onboarding profile, artifact budget, and shared evidence bundle when
  running inside the integrated stack.

## Dependencies

Hard: None.

Soft:
- session-start-progressive-disclosure for new or unfamiliar project calibration
- context-matrix-map when docs/agents/context-matrix.md exists or discovery is needed
- grill-with-docs when project language, boundaries, or artifact definitions require user decisions
- project-standards-calibration after context when standards need a durable profile
- agent-instructions-integrator after context when routing should reference root CONTEXT.md
- verification-before-completion before complete/evidence-backed/future-agent claims

Fallback: If companion skills or project docs are unavailable, inspect minimal evidence and mark lower-confidence gaps in CONTEXT.md.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the target-project boundary:
   - Identify the project root from the user request, current directory, or repository metadata.
   - Treat the `CONTEXT.md` being written as the target project's root context file.
   - Keep this source skill library, installed skill folders, and target-project artifacts distinct.
   - If the root is ambiguous, inspect one local source such as `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, a package manifest, or a README before asking the user.

2. Reuse shared onboarding evidence:
   - Start with fresh evidence already collected by discovery or source mapping.
   - Inspect additional sources only when the bundle cannot support a durable
     boundary, term, or artifact definition.
   - Add compact provenance, freshness, finding, and confidence updates for
     later onboarding artifacts to reuse.

3. Use the context matrix when present:
   - If `docs/agents/context-matrix.md` exists, read it first and use its first-read and second-read sources to choose evidence.
   - If no context matrix exists, do a narrow discovery pass for README files, docs indexes, existing context or glossary docs, ADRs, PRDs, agent instructions, and project manifests.
   - Do not recreate the context matrix inside `CONTEXT.md`; use it only to find source-grounded context.

4. Inspect the existing context file when refreshing:
   - Read root `CONTEXT.md` before editing it.
   - Preserve accurate project-specific facts, terms, and artifact definitions.
   - Mark stale, conflicting, or weakly sourced content as a gap or assumption instead of silently deleting project knowledge.
   - Do not confuse the target project's root `CONTEXT.md` with this GOATED source repo's root `CONTEXT.md`.

5. Calibrate project boundaries:
   - Capture what the project is, what it is not, and which adjacent systems, packages, products, repositories, or domains are outside its scope.
   - Include public/private boundaries when they matter for future agents.
   - Prefer source-backed statements from docs, manifests, repo layout, ADRs, or user-confirmed decisions.
   - Ask only when a boundary is materially ambiguous and cannot be inferred from local evidence.

6. Calibrate domain language:
   - Collect terms future agents must use consistently, such as product concepts, actors, workflows, feature names, status labels, data concepts, and overloaded words.
   - Define terms from project evidence first and user clarification second.
   - Keep definitions short and operational: what the term means in this project and where the evidence came from.
   - Avoid broad glossary building when the terms do not affect agent work.

7. Calibrate durable artifact definitions:
   - Define durable project artifacts that future agents should recognize, such as `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/agents/context-matrix.md`, `docs/agents/project-standards.md`, PRDs, ADRs, issue handoffs, public docs, and temporary or tracked handoffs when the project uses them.
   - For each artifact, capture its purpose, default path or convention, whether it is tracked or local, and what it should not replace.
   - Keep standards and enforcement rules in `docs/agents/project-standards.md`, not in `CONTEXT.md`.

8. Calibrate reusable architecture vocabulary:
   - Capture stable architecture terms future agents need across tasks, such as feature, module, service, adapter, seam, layer, package, route, schema, or project-specific equivalents.
   - Ground terms in docs or representative source structure when possible.
   - Keep this to vocabulary and orientation. Do not draw diagrams, evaluate architecture quality, propose refactors, or invent new architectural decisions.
   - If architecture terms are contested or decision-heavy, record the gap and recommend an ADR or architecture-design-map follow-up.

9. Write or incrementally refresh the default tracked artifact:
   - Use root `CONTEXT.md` inside the target project unless the user explicitly requested another tracked path.
   - Preserve accurate content and update only stale, contradicted, or
     demonstrated missing sections. Do not rebuild the file from a blank
     template merely to normalize its shape.
   - Include gaps and assumptions instead of pretending weak evidence is settled.
   - Date the update and list the main evidence paths and commands used.

10. Stop when future agents share the same language:
   - Do not keep exploring to map every source file or explain every subsystem.
   - Defer source-routing gaps to `context-matrix-map`.
   - Defer standards, coding conventions, and enforcement levels to `project-standards-calibration`.
   - Defer diagrams and source-grounded architecture maps to `architecture-design-map`.
   - Defer refactor recommendations to architecture improvement or delivery-specific workflows.
   - Use `verification-before-completion` before claiming the context file is complete, evidence-backed, or ready for future agents.

## Output Contract

Write root `CONTEXT.md` with this shape by default:

```markdown
# Project Context

## Purpose

One short paragraph explaining how future agents should use this file.

## Project Boundaries

| Boundary | In scope | Out of scope | Evidence or notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Domain Language

| Term | Meaning in this project | Evidence or notes |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Durable Artifacts

| Artifact | Default path | Purpose | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Architecture Vocabulary

| Term | Meaning in this project | Evidence or notes |
| --- | --- | --- |

## Gaps And Assumptions

- <unknown, weakly sourced, stale, or user-confirmed assumption>

## Last Updated

- Date: <YYYY-MM-DD>
- Updated by: <agent or user label>
- Evidence used: <brief list of paths and commands>
```

After writing the file, report:

- artifact path;
- key project boundaries and terms captured;
- gaps or assumptions that still need the user;
- evidence paths and commands used;
- recommended next onboarding skill, if any.

In integrated use, return these items as an internal envelope delta unless a
conflict, blocker, material route change, or explicit user request justifies a
visible report.

## Delegation

Main owns the target-project boundary, final terminology, user questions, context-file edits, and user communication.

Delegate only bounded evidence scans: terminology in docs/specs/issues, durable artifacts under root docs or `docs/agents/`, architecture-language usage in ADRs/notes/source layout, or contradictions between existing `CONTEXT.md` and current evidence.

Require paths inspected, commands run or skipped, exact source evidence, assumptions/confidence, and candidate terms, artifact definitions, or contradictions rather than final `CONTEXT.md` prose. If subagents are unavailable, run the same scans sequentially with a narrower context budget; do not promote unevidenced summaries into project context.

## Guardrails

- Do not ask the user about discoverable facts before inspecting available project evidence.
- Do not create `CONTEXT.md` without a demonstrated durable terminology or
  boundary need, or erase accurate existing knowledge during refresh.
- Do not treat this GOATED source repo's root `CONTEXT.md` as the target project's context unless this source repo is explicitly the target project.
- Do not make `CONTEXT.md` a source map, exhaustive glossary, onboarding tutorial, standards profile, architecture diagram, ADR, PRD, handoff, or refactor plan.
- Do not duplicate `docs/agents/context-matrix.md`; use it to find sources and leave source read-order there.
- Do not duplicate `docs/agents/project-standards.md`; leave standards, conventions, preferences, checks, and enforcement levels there.
- Do not invent architecture vocabulary, project boundaries, or artifact meanings without source evidence or user confirmation.
- Do not include ignored local scratch files, private notes, credentials, client data, or sensitive personal context unless the user explicitly requests a private artifact.
- Prefer "unknown", "not found in this pass", or an unresolved question over guessing.
