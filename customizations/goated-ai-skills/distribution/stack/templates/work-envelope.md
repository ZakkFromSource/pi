# Work Envelope

Use this compact logical state protocol when the integrated stack needs shared
task state. It is not a mandatory tracked artifact. The stable core is goal,
scope, action reach, and next action. Populate other fields only when they
change routing, approval, proof, or resumability; omit skipped gates when
recording them would add no useful context.

```yaml
schema_version: 1.0.0

profile: # optional; include only routing-relevant dimensions
  task_size: # tiny | standard | large
  intent_maturity: # fuzzy | scoped | implementation-ready

```

The `approval`, `route_signals`, and `changes` blocks are optional; omit them
when they add no decision value. The `clarification` block is also optional:
specialist grills update it and the existing evidence, decisions, open
questions, route, and next fields as a delta rather than emitting another full
closeout. Approval remains valid while its covered scope and action reach still
cover the work. A material change to either marks it
`fresh-approval-required` before the expanded action.

Other optional extensions may record a fixed point, artifacts, delegated work,
risks, or resume information. Do not add runtime cost, provider, model-ranking,
or Factory metric fields.

Keep single-session state in conversation or framework-native state. For
resumable work, use
`.local/goated/work-envelopes/<effort-slug>.md` only after confirming
`.local/` is ignored. Use operating-system temporary storage otherwise.
Nothing becomes tracked without deliberate user intent.
